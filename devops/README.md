# Introduction - 10 Minutes
Please present a short executive summary of your career to the team.
Please showcase an automation, monitoring or a project that you wrote that you are proud of. We would love to understand what the problem was, your method of solving it and the outcome. Please highlight the devops philosophy in the project.

# Craft Demonstration

Our Python Engineers are want to deploy their Python3 microservice. The engineering team is well-versed in Python but they are struggling with how to deploy the right SDLC (software development lifecycle). This team has reached out to you as a member of one of our platform teams to discuss how you would approach this problem.


## Demonstration

Given the team's requirements as listed here, please be prepared to discuss the following points with your interview team:

* For each requirement and the information provided, are there any other questions you feel you need to clarify with the team about their projects? 
* What kind of monitoring would you recommend the team put into place? 
* What kind of CI/CD do you recommend?
* How will you measure the success of the changes you have suggested to meet the needs of that specific requirement? For example, if you suggest a totally new source control system (not recommended), how will you measure the value provided by this change over time?
* Are there are any other new requirements you would suggest to the team that they may not have considered in order to best meet the goals of the project as described?


** While this is mostly a conversation, and some candidates may want to draw diagrams during the call, some candidates might find it helpful to have some pre-made diagrams. Either option is perfectly acceptable to us. **
