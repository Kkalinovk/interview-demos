Our Python Engineers want to deploy their Python3 microservice. The engineering team is well-versed in Python but they are struggling with how to deploy the right SDLC (software development lifecycle). This team has reached out to you as a member of one of our platform teams to discuss how you would approach this problem.

* Are there any other questions you feel you need to clarify with the team about their devops strategy? 
* What kind of deployment automation will you recommend?
* What kind of monitoring would you recommend the team put into place?
* What kind of security policies would you recommend?
* How will you measure the success of the changes you have suggested to meet the needs of that specific requirement? For example, if you suggest a totally new source control system (not recommended), how will you measure the value provided by this change over time?
* Are there are any other new requirements you would suggest to the team that they may not have considered in order to best meet the goals of the project as described?
